### Overview  
>- In this lab, you will build a React application that displays a list of user profile cards. You'll use reusable components with props, manage interactivity using useState, and use Axios to fetch user data from an
external API.


>How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
>Actually, it didn’t take much time — maybe less than 3 hours — and I also completed the bonus tasks: dark mode toggle and search functionality

> Were there any parts of the lab you found challenging??
>When I tried to send an Axios request to the RandomUser API using async/await, it didn’t work as expected.After searching, I found that I needed to use the useEffect hook to handle the request properly.I also implemented the name search functionality, allowing the user to trigger rendering by typing.
